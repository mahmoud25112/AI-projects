the youtube downloader is in the script called youtube_downloader.py it's a simple application where you run the code input the link and it downloads the video along with the captions if it has english captions as for the vode for 
preprocssing the video it's in the folder in preprocess using Open cv lib for video operations. and the model for the trained autoencoder is here. I also included samples of the files for the objects that weere
detected using my obect detector, and I did the same same thing for vector emeddings and I providied the code for the autoencoder.
the classify Obj scrip was used to cut the objects out of the frame after each object was detected.
